    <h1>Liza's Favorite Movies</h1>  
    <h2>My Top Three Movies (At Least Right Now)</h2>
    <hr width="100%" size="2">
    <h3>Interstellar</h3>
        <p>Let's just start with Christopher Nolan is a genius filmmaker.  I admit I am a sci-fi nerd when it comes to movies, but this so was so well put together.  It was compelling in it's story-telling, breath-taking in its vistas, and heart-wrenching in the exploration of relationships. Finally, Hans Zimmer expertly captured the feelings of each scene with his score.</p>
    <h3>Blade Runner</h3>
        <p>I think I would call this a first love.  When I first watched it as a kid, I thought it was so edgy.  My persistent crush on Harrison Ford didn't hurt, either.  However, this adaptation of Philip Dick's "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?" was my first foray into the ponderances of science fiction.</p>
    <h3>Ghost in the Shell (Original Anime Version)</h3>
        <p>This movie was my introduction to anime.  And what an introduction.  An exploration of whether or not an android can have a soul, this movie wrapped that concept in a mystery and international politics.  Beautifully drawn and scored, this movie captured me and made me a fan for life.</p>
